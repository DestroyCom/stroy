# Stroy - A streaming website on REACT
In order to train myself in REACT.js, I coded "Stroy", a streaming website based in react.

## Why this project and why this name ?
This project was launched so that I could deepen my knowledge of react.js

This project is called Stroy, to echo the branding of some of my personal projects (like Stroybot - the twitch bot)

## What did I use ?
I only used create-react-app which includes babel, webpack and ESlint and plyr.

## Where can I see the result ?
A demo is available at https://stroystreaming.netlify.app/
